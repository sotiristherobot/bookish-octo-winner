How the project works

Enter a value in the Employer tab, and click submit. If you do not click submit, the value will not be submitted but it 
will be preserved. (You can click on the Employee tab and then click again on the Employer tab and your last entered
value will be there). Once you click submit in either tab, there is no way to go back since the submit button will be
disabled and a prompt to wait for the other part will appear to the user. (The input for that specific tab will dissapear).
When both tabs are submitted the appropriate message will appear to the user.

Below are the steps as described by the react scripts to run the scripts for the project. 
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
